In order to reduce users’ tiredness when they are forced awake, the traditional smart alarm function wakes users up when they are not in deep sleep. Inspired by this, we develop an algorithm which can predict users’ sleep quality during a given time window and minimize their pitfalls by waking them up at the best time. The Markov Chain models, second order Mixture Transition Distribution (MTD) model, and MTDg model are used to simulate the sleeping process. Parameters in these models are estimated by maximizing their log- likelihood. The Bayesian Information Criterion is introduced to compare different models. The second order Markov Chain is proved to have the best goodness-of-fit, and thus is adopted as the foundation of the prediction algorithm. Our prediction algorithm performs better than the traditional ones in terms of their error rates.
